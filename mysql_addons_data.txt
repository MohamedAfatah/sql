(44, '67c7c5441f208d60dd0101ee', 'How data modernisation drives competitive success. By adopting data modernisation, businesses can gain faster, more accurate insights and boost efficiency by optimising data processes. As businesses generate and engage with ever-increasing volumes of data, leveraging modern infrastructure to analyse and harness information in real-time has become a cornerstone of competitive advantage. Upgrading legacy systems to more agile, scalable, and integrated platforms enables companies to unlock new growth opportunities, enhance decision-making processes, and respond quickly to market demands — representing a critical differentiator in today’s data-driven world. The evolution of enterprise data management has shifted from traditional, on-premises databases designed for structured data to modern, cloud-based data platforms that can handle diverse data types at scale. In the past, businesses relied on rigid, siloed databases that were difficult to integrate, resulting in inefficiencies and data silos. As data types, volume and velocity continue to grow exponentially, legacy systems are struggling to keep pace, leading to challenges such as limited scalability, slow analytics, and fragmented data landscapes. Today, enterprises face a pressing need to tackle these challenges by modernising their data infrastructure to unlock seamless data integration, real-time analytics, and more agile decision-making capabilities. Data modernisation involves a comprehensive overhaul of an organisation’s data infrastructure to meet the demands of the digital age. This includes migrating data from legacy systems to the cloud, as well as adopting data lakes and data meshes for storing vast amounts of structured or unstructured data, enabling real-time analytics, and integrating AI-driven tools for advanced insights. By embracing data modernisation, enterprises can tap into significant benefits, such as enhanced decision-making through faster and more accurate data analysis and improved operational efficiency by streamlining data processes. They can also foster innovation by leveraging cutting-edge technologies. Several foundational components are critical to transforming an organisation’s data capabilities: Cloud integration, Advanced analytics and AI, Data governance and security, and Data democratisation. These components collectively empower enterprises to leverage data more effectively, driving innovation and competitiveness in an increasingly data-driven landscape.', 'eand', '2025-03-05 03:30:12', 188, 'e&_enterprise', 'https://www.eandenterprise.com/en/news-and-insights/articles/article-data-modernisation.html'),

Traditional on-site PACS take up valuable healthcare real estate and require on-site interventions for challenges faced with hosting hardware. \n\nThe solution will give Smart Salem access to guaranteed future-proof technology that enhances operational effectiveness, improves care management, and maximises return on investment (ROI) but also serves as a model for future healthcare innovations. The platform will integrate seamlessly with Smart Salem’s existing Hospital Information Systems (HIS) and offer comprehensive support services. Deploying this cloud technology is a critical first step in the project, leading to the later adoption of AI technology in early identification of diseases based on imaging data.\n\nSalvador Anglada, Chief Executive Officer, e& enterprise, said: “Joining forces with Smart Salem on this pioneering project underscores e& enterprise’s commitment to disrupting the digital healthcare sector and transforming traditional healthcare operations. By delivering the first solution in the region, the cloud-based PACS platform is expected to set a precedent for future healthcare projects, opening up new opportunities for scalable growth and value-added services.”\n\nAmanda Gravitis, Chief Executive Officer, Smart Salem, said: “At Smart Salem we are committed to staying at the forefront of healthcare innovation so we are excited to be implementing the UAE’s first locally hosted cloud based PACS, in collaboration with e& enterprise. The solution will improve imaging accessibility, efficiency and data security across our network, ensuring we continue to provide the UAE’s most premium, technology-enabled medical, visa and healthcare services.”\n\nThis project positions e& enterprise and Smart Salem as early movers in the medical imaging sector, creating a robust foundation for growth and expansion into other healthcare services. It also contributes to broader societal and environmental goals by reducing the carbon footprint associated with IT infrastructure and minimising the need for patient and staff commuting, supporting a more sustainable healthcare ecosystem.\n\nThe cloud-based PACS solution offers numerous benefits to healthcare providers and stakeholders alike, starting with cost efficiency by significantly reducing the infrastructure costs typically associated with traditional on-premises medical imaging systems. It delivers unmatched scalability and data accessibility, allowing healthcare professionals to scale operations effortlessly and securely access patient data remotely. With built-in disaster recovery and robust data security measures, the system ensures compliance with strict data protection regulations, safeguarding patient information at all times.\n\nThis innovative platform is also designed to support long-term IT management with advanced storage capabilities and analytics, empowering healthcare providers to make data-driven decisions that improve patient outcomes.\n\nContact: \n\n- e& Media Office \n  - Shilpa Villait +971505973304\n  - Nancy Sudheer +971507055290\n  - Amer Obaid +9715660616\n  - Noha Serageldin +971507010247\n  - Grace Eid +971525434411\n  - mediaoffice@eand.com\n\n- Smart Salem:\n  - Emily Plimsoll\n  - emily.plimsoll@smartsalem.ae\n  - 0553531522\n\n© 2025 e&.

UAE tech and telecoms company e& – formerly Etisalat – is looking at more acquisitions in the GCC as well as Africa and Eastern Europe. “We are in processes as we speak,” said Salvador Anglada, CEO of e& enterprise, during an exclusive roundtable at Gitex. The telecoms major rebranded from Etisalat last year to become a technology and investment company. Since its transition from a “telco to a techco” the group has acquired stakes in companies including ride-hailer Careem, streaming service Starzplay, lending platform Beehive, South Korean cloud management company Bespin Global and PPF Telecom Group in Eastern Europe. Anglada believes that telecom as an industry “is saturated”, which is why it was an “intelligent” decision for the company to expand its business by introducing new pillars such as utilities, aviation and retail. With 165 million aggregate subscribers, the telecoms arm is driving cash flow, which is helping the group to fund its expansion and acquisitions. It reported consolidated revenues of AED 26.6 billion in the first half of 2023. “The cash flow generation of telco is quite heavy,” Anglada said. “The free cash flow is around $4 to $5 billion. So the expansion is coming because we are able to fund that.” However, the long-term plan is for the group to go public, he added. “The way the company has been structured will allow (us) to eventually IPO the business.

Developed as a collaboration between the World Governments Summit (WGS) Organisation, e& and Code.org, the report provides insights into the nation\'s commitment to fostering digital literacy and preparing citizens for 21st-century challenges.\nShifting away from traditional sectors, the UAE Government has made a decisive commitment to knowledge-based growth. With a substantial education budget of USD 2.7 billion in 2023 and USD 2.8 billion in 2024, the nation prioritises programming and emerging technologies, aiming to transform and diversify its economic landscape. This aligns with the UAE National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence, which focuses on developing elite tech talent.\nAli Al Mansoori, Group Chief Human Resources Officer at e&, said: “In an era where digital frontiers are expanding at an unprecedented pace, equipping our children with robust computer science skills, including coding and an understanding of generative AI, is not just an asset—it’s a necessity. As we build these digital skills in our youth, we empower our workforce, ensuring our country’s competitive edge in a world where technology is the universal language of progress.”\nEmphasising the development of elite tech talent, the UAE invests substantially in education, allocating funds to universities and implementing directives to enhance computational thinking. Currently, 24% of the population possesses programming skills, in line with the UAE National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence.

Initiatives like the ongoing collaboration with Code.org play a crucial role in reshaping educational landscapes and ensuring digital skills are accessible to students worldwide.\nPat Yongpradit, Chief Academic Officer for Code.org, said: “Code.org has been a game-changer in the global education landscape, tackling the digital divide head-on. By providing resources, training, and advocacy, we’ve opened doors for millions of students worldwide to learn computer science and helped UAE students use these skills to continue the tradition of innovation in the country.”\nThe UAE anticipates continuous innovation and efforts to raise awareness about CS education, combined with enhanced resources and comprehensive teacher training to solidify its position as a global leader in digital literacy, preparing the youth for the dynamic demands of the 21st Century workforce.\nMore than 4,000 participants from the public and private sectors will participate in 110 interactive sessions at WGS 2024, including 200 speakers from 80 international, regional, and intergovernmental organizations including the UN, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the World Health Organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Arab League.

Beehive, founded in 2014, leads the crowdfunding platform space in the UAE, with operations in KSA and Oman. It connects creditworthy SMEs seeking finance with investors, both private and institutional, offering conventional as well as Sharia compliant loans. The company recently reached the milestone of facilitating over AED 1.5 billion worth of loans. With this acquisition, e& enterprise will be able to provide an innovative lending solution to address the $250 billion SME credit gap across the GCC region combining its strong brand positioning with a Fintech platform. This also marks the next step in e& enterprise’s expansion as the move demonstrates its commitment of opening new avenues of growth across the UAE and in the region, while enabling Beehive to scale its business and expand its offerings. The acquisition is in-line with UAE’s National Agenda for Entrepreneurship which aims to establish the country to become an entrepreneurial nation by 2031. Salvador Anglada, CEO, e& enterprise commented: “The acquisition of Beehive’s digital lending platform marks the second step in e& enterprise’s journey in the Fintech space, after the launch of UAE Trade Connect in 2021. SMEs are important drivers of the economy and there is a need more than ever to support their unique financing needs. With Beehive, we have the right technological innovation to accelerate on our agenda in the UAE and beyond.” Craig Moore, Beehive’s Founder & CEO added “This strategic alignment presents a huge opportunity to increase and accelerate financing to SMEs across the region. The market leading brand, reach and vision of e& and e& enterprise allows Beehive to drive more innovation and collaboration into the market. As one of the very first regional Fintech’s, this is a validation of the Beehive team’s incredible effort over the last 9 years and reflects the vibrancy and success of the UAE’s start up ecosystem.” Traditional lending to SME’s is paper-intensive and relies on collateral and guarantees. Fintechs and alternative lenders have recently stepped into this space introducing advancements such as one-time KYC, fast onboarding, and use of data-driven credit scoring. The regulatory structure is also evolving rapidly in the region, fostering a conducive environment for both liquidity providers and borrowers.', 'eand', '2025-03-05 05:01:21', 188, 'e&_enterprise', 'https://www.eandenterprise.com/en/news-and-insights/press-release/Majority-stake-acquired-in-beehive-fintech.html'),

This landmark initiative is set to transform e&\'s vehicle fleet in the UAE, with the first phase involving the replacement of 100 vehicles with EVs.\nThis follows e&\'s recent announcement at COP28, where it committed to achieving zero carbon emissions across its own operations, covering Scope 1 and 2, by 2040, embarking on a decisive journey towards environmental sustainability.  In support of this objective, the company also announced near term targets (2030) of a Group-wide reduction of 43 per cent from its own activities and the energy it purchases and uses (Scope 1 and 2 emissions).\nObaid Bokisha, Group Chief Operations Officer of e&, said: “e& is committed to environmentally friendly transport and reducing its carbon footprint. Our initiative to replace all light vehicles with electric vehicles demonstrates our commitment to addressing climate change and embracing cleaner, greener technologies.\n“e& is actively seeking innovative solutions to replace its entire fleet gradually as it addresses the requirement for suitable electric vehicles in various categories. As a responsible organisation, e& intends to align its efforts with the goals and priorities established in COP28, stressing the importance of promoting the adoption of electric vehicles as part of the discussions and commitments at the conference.”\nWhile the transition to EVs presents significant challenges, e& is determined to drive positive change and set an example for others to follow. The global technology group recognises the impact of EVs on operations, emphasising the need to address challenges and seize opportunities for cost savings, efficiency, and environmental impact reduction.\nThe momentum behind EVs is expected to grow exponentially, with global sales soaring, and the UAE is making significant strides. Industry statistics reveal that more than 10 million electric cars were sold worldwide in 2022 and this is expected to grow by another 35 per cent to reach 14 million1.\nAs part of its sustainability efforts, e& is also investing in building charging infrastructure and establishing EV charging infrastructure at its parking bases.

We’ve set aggressive targets for net-zero emissions by 2030. Our ‘sustainability as a service’ initiative helps clients manage their carbon footprint and energy consumption effectively. We’ve seen an increased demand for such sustainability products from both government and non-government entities. We have set ambitious targets within our telecom sector. Our services will aid customers in managing their carbon footprint and energy efficiency. Our comprehensive sustainability programme involves over 30 services to improve energy efficiency across various sectors, like Fleet Management and urban lighting. Not only are we responsible for COP28 – in fact, e& is the main sponsor. However, it’s not merely about supporting global activities; we want to showcase our commitment to sustainability. We’ve set very strict targets for 2030, aiming for net-zero emissions in scope one and two within the telco, an ambitious goal I’ve rarely seen elsewhere. There’s a growing demand for sustainability products. In the past 12 to 18 months, this demand has significantly increased. It wasn’t previously on the agenda, but now, most government and non-government entities are considering it. Our proposition aligns well with their needs, helping them understand and tackle these issues, set targets, and monitor their performance against those targets. It’s just the beginning. Companies taking this seriously are witnessing higher customer propensity and enhanced market value. Companies with a sustainability agenda are seeing a lower cost of capital due to their three-year sustainability roadmap for the future.', 'eand', '2025-03-05 05:22:46', 188, 'e&_enterprise', 'https://www.eandenterprise.com/en/news-and-insights/press-release/sustainability-and-digitalisation.html'),

Being an Emirati company, we are proud of our rich heritage and adopt the same cultural values and morals across all aspects of our business, hoping to bridge the gap between the UAE’s humble roots and its objective to become one of the most digitally advanced and well-connected countries in the world. The UAE has achieved incredible milestones over the past 50 years, and will continue to do so over the next 50 years. It is a beacon of hope in the world, the shining example of tolerance and unity. People from hundreds of nations, with all sorts of different customs and folklore, have coexisted in harmony over the past years.

Etisalat celebrated Labour Day by honouring the ‘hidden’ heroes of the UAE and gifting 15 construction workers each the means to build their children’s futures, in recognition of their efforts in building our cities.

With every new day, it inspires creations, creates stories, connects journeys, sparks friendships, celebrates traditions, and empowers dreams. It is the belief that when we all come together, anything is possible. Doing something alone is great, but when we do something together the feeling is indescribable. When we come together the possibilities are endless; whether with friends, family, colleagues, or strangers there is always something extra special to be made in that moment of togetherness.

(337, '67c7e31d1f208d60dd03c3d9', 'Abu Dhabi, 26 February 2022: Following the announcement of e&\'s transformation as the global technology conglomerate, the Group has already started to accelerate its digitalisation leadership further by implementing its ambitious strategy for a brighter, digital future. Refreshing the Group\'s business pillars in alignment with its objectives for geographical expansion, deeper market penetration, profitable ventures and acquisitions, exploring adjacencies will only serve to amplify business growth across all segments. H.E. Jassem Mohamed Bu Ataba Alzaabi, Chairman of e&, has highlighted that the Group’s strong financial performance and stellar business results across the markets where it operates have placed it on solid footing to start a new chapter of success. The Chairman was speaking at a Media Majlis on 26 February 2022, where the Group shared how well-placed it was to drive its aspirations through specialist business pillars. This multi-billion dollar business has seen a series of victories since it started operations in 1976 as the first telecom company in the UAE. The Group was named the strongest telecoms brand in the world in January 2022. It also took first place in the Forbes MENA Top 10 most valuable listed companies in the UAE. More recently, it reported a solid net profit of AED 9.3 billion in 2021, a 3.2% increase year on year. It\'s also seen a jump of 3.0 % increase in its aggregated subscriber base to 159 million. The Group has also been aggressive in its acquisition strategy and in its pursuit of strategic partnerships that are set to revolutionise the business landscape. H.E. said, “Our exemplary financials and strong standing in the market demonstrate our strength and capability to take our success to new heights as we refocus our efforts in investing in breakthrough technologies, accelerating in-depth market penetrations and capitalising on solid ventures with key industry players. “Moreover, the digital revolution and its impact on the business world has given us ample confidence to expand even further through the business pillars.” Looking ahead, the Group is in a privileged position in the MENA region to capture regional growth opportunities while looking into markets beyond the region. e& possesses an undisputed market position across the MENA region with an ICT market size across the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, three of its key markets, expected to grow by more than 15% annually from 2020 to 2025. Moreover, the business landscape has seen an explosive rate of digital disruption, with significant digital white spaces remaining in the MENA region. H.E. highlighted what needs to happen for the Group to ride the change. He said: “Driven by our track record of success and milestone achievements we have witnessed so far, we are confident in leading the digitalisation conversation. It is our determination to accomplish more for the benefit of our customers and shareholders through our commitment to enhancing the quality of our solutions and services. We are the bridge builders who have mastered the art of combining our scalable technological competencies with our robust telecoms expertise so that we can drive positive change for our customers, unlock more shareholder value and strengthen our global presence. “Through our main business pillars, we are creating a future-ready business model that celebrates our past and embraces the opportunities ahead of us.” Business pillars driving the Group’s aspirations The Group\'s specialist business pillars are its strategy building blocks as it sets on its journey to build a brighter, digital future. Telecoms: The Group\'s growth engine, Telecoms is set to accelerate its growth to enable its expansion into new geographic markets while boosting operational performance in existing markets. With a strong presence in 16 countries across the Middle East, Asia and Africa, this business operation will explore new geographies through building strong partnerships and scaling synergies in the telecom industry. In the age of ‘connectivity renaissance,’ its innovation, imagination and implementation of ideas will drive smart connectivity and maximise value creation for all its customer segments. With a progressive mindset, Telecoms will drive brand equity and boost global customer satisfaction, achieve synergies of scale, expand its digital services and explore adjacent businesses, thus abiding by its promise to deliver outstanding customer experiences at all times. e& life: This business pillar brings the next-gen digital world to the fingertips of its customers via a state-of-the-art ‘super app’ marketplace. It aims to target specific consumer segments and advance new business growth opportunities, amplifying innovative consumer digital offerings across the board. As the major value contributor to the Group, e& life will play a critical role in driving its consumer’s digital future via a suite of carefully curated consumer products and smart connectivity platforms. The ‘super app’ marketplace, e& life provides customers with cutting-edge lifestyle services, from online food ordering and entertainment (through majority-owned platforms) to retail, mobility and finance. e& enterprise: Combining the agility and expertise of a digital managed and professional service company with the strength and reach of a telco, e& enterprise is leading digital transformation and accelerating digital adoption for corporates, governments and large organisations. Through Cloud, Cybersecurity, Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence, it is propelling organisations and economies towards a smarter, safer and more sustainable world. With a successful track record in designing, delivering and operating large digital projects and solutions using intelligent and secure cloud platforms, e& enterprise provides comprehensive services in consultancy, business modelling, solutions design, program management, execution, delivery and post-implementation support. e& capital: Focussed on bringing a better, alternate future, e& capital is investing in the ideas and people that will take us there. Acquiring, growing and supporting the visionary tech businesses that are moving this world forward. e& is working on long term financial growth, choosing technology investments that will create high returns, and companies that fit it with the Group\'s aspirations. Resilient business model underpinned by strong financials Hatem Dowidar, Group CEO, e&, further explained the successes that the Group has had in maximising value from the core, expanding and solidifying its regional footprint leadership, as well as the strong financial results. He stressed the importance of embracing a progressive outlook, harnessing a growth mindset to see beyond the world of telecoms so as to create a bright, digital future. He said: “Technological disruption brought with it winds of change that we’ve never seen before. Instead of us standing at the crossroads, wondering what to do next, we started to ask, “How can we capture and accelerate growth and still stay strong and successful?” The answer is plain to see. Our quest to go beyond the realms of telecom exhorted us to ideate, design and deploy solutions that would transform the lives of our customers and advance the digitalisation journey of enterprises. “Part of this journey involved us taking massive steps to explore adjacencies, looking at how we can create focussed digital units, building strong partnerships and exploring collaborative opportunities that would attract out-of-industry partners and investors. We are pleased with the progress made thus far, indicating that the Group is ready for growth, quipped with clear strategic imperatives that will accelerate digital transformation.” Embedding sustainability at the core H.E. spoke at length about the importance of understanding how the work at e& changes people’s lives at every touchpoint. In his parting words, he said: “While our robust financial performance has given us a clear snapshot of our readiness to embark on this new journey, we are also constantly focussing on how our work impacts people’s lives. One of the key reasons that we have been able to rise to any challenge and stay agile constantly, is because we believe that we are making a difference in the lives of millions. Enhancing customer experiences and empowering societies have always been our driving forces in everything we have done in the past and what we will achieve in the future. “We will continue to step up and innovate at every opportunity presented to us in a time of accelerated digitalisation.” Commenting on the Group’s commitment to the critical role of living by sustainability principles, Dowidar highlighted that they have put several measures in place to address the footprint across the board. E&’s ESG rating was upgraded from ‘BBB’ to ‘A’ by MSCI Global Index, after it launched the sustainability framework and enhanced policies in line with international best practices. Dowidar said: “To continue to deliver on the agenda of sustainability, we have joined ICT sectors for Paris Agreement commitments to Net Zero emission by 2050. We are also looking at accelerating the decarbonisation of activities by reducing GHG by 2030. We have a clear responsibility to drive sustainable operations for the sake of the future generations and so we will do what it takes to tackle issues such as climate change, global warming and environmental conservation.” Moving forward, e& will embark on the next wave of core transformation in the UAE telco business to de-risk against market headwinds. Scaling synergies for international expansion will be driven by diversifying footprint risks and reducing home market dependency. Last but not least, a more transparent and agile business model is in the works to open doors for more strategic partnerships, investments, and M&A opportunities.', 'eand', '2025-03-05 05:37:33', 188, 'consumer', 'https://www.eand.com/en/news/26-feb-2022-eand-transformation-into-a-global-technology-conglomerate.html'),

Key factors contributing to this momentum include robust government support, focused research, investments in infrastructure, strategic upskilling, and cross-sector collaboration. Governments are particularly enthusiastic about AI due to the significant economic value it promises, further accelerating its integration across industries.\nHarrison Lung, Group Chief Strategy Officer, e&, said: “As the MENA region stands on the brink of an AI-driven future, the timing of this research collaboration between e& and IBM could not be more crucial. This report serves as a roadmap for CEOs and policymakers to bridge the gap between ambition and execution, enabling the MENA region to cement its position as a global leader in AI innovation.”\nWhile 54 per cent of MENA CEOs recognise advanced GenAI as critical to gaining a competitive edge, the report also reveals significant barriers, including challenges in tech readiness, data privacy, security, and talent development. These obstacles underscore the need for a strong focus on foundational capabilities—such as upskilling talent, and scaling infrastructure and data systems to match regional ambitions.\n“We are proud to partner with e&, to capture the region’s readiness to accelerate AI’s impact across sectors. Together, we are helping CEOs and boards navigate the AI frontier, with a clear focus on building infrastructure, scaling talent, and unlocking data to fuel business success,” said Saad Toma, General Manager, IBM Middle East and Africa.\nOther key findings include:\nWhile CEOs across the region recognise the importance of digital infrastructure, confidence in its ability to support scaling and deliver new investments has sharply declined—from 82 per cent in 2023 to 64 per cent in 2024.\n54 per cent of tech leaders in the region believe their organisations have the necessary technology risk tolerance to successfully execute AI strategies—lagging the global figure of 63 per cent.\nMENA CEOs cited organisational resistance to change from top management (41%) and employees (43%) as barriers to innovation.\nFive priorities for AI transformation\nThe report also outlines five key priorities to drive AI transformation in the MENA region, helping CEOs accelerate their AI initiatives and scale effectively.\nWhile public partnerships are helping, organisations must align their talent strategies with business needs to stay competitive in the AI-driven future.\nModernising data architecture is a critical focus, with 46 per cent of MENA CEOs recognising its importance for achieving AI goals in the next three years.\nTalent acquisition and retention remain a challenge, with only 23 per cent of MENA CEOs prioritising talent strategy. While public-private partnerships are helping, organisations must align their talent strategies with business needs to stay competitive in the AI-driven future.\nResponsible AI is increasingly important for sustainable growth. With rising concerns over data privacy and regulatory compliance—identified by 48 per cent and 43 per cent of MENA CEOs as top barriers to GenAI adoption—organisations must implement robust AI governance frameworks to ensure compliance and build trust.\nThe MENA region’s national AI strategies and public-private partnerships are pivotal for advancing AI adoption. By leveraging government support, the region can build an integrated ecosystem that aligns strategy, infrastructure, and talent while fostering an innovation-driven mindset.\n“With visionary leadership, abundant resources, and a digitally empowered population, the region is uniquely positioned to chart its own transformative AI journey. However, turning this potential into measurable impact requires bold, pragmatic action—investing in tailored infrastructure, nurturing talent, and embracing collaboration to address regional nuances,” Harrison added.\nTo unlock AI\'s full potential and drive regional transformation, the report also identifies key imperatives that bridge strategy and execution. These imperatives offer a blueprint for regional CEOs to align leadership, integrate resources, optimise operations, and leverage public-private collaboration to create a dynamic and sustainable AI ecosystem.\nLeadership alignment: Successful AI integration demands cohesive C-suite leadership, aligning business goals, technology, and financial strategies with clear objectives and adaptive decision-making.\nIntegrated strategy: A comprehensive AI strategy links infrastructure, data, and talent to business goals, ensuring adaptability to regulations and market demands.\nOperational excellence: Balance quick wins with long-term growth through agile decisions, scalable solutions, and clarity on internal versus external capabilities.\nPublic-private partnerships: Building on public sector AI investments fosters collaboration, aligns innovation, and drives shared progress across the region.\nAI adoption demands a tailored approach\nThe MENA region is diverse, with significant differences in economic structures, regulatory environments, and technological readiness. As a result, AI strategies must be tailored to individual markets rather than applying a one-size-fits-all approach.\nWhat sets the region apart is its unique combination of ambitious national visions, substantial investments, and strengths like abundant capital, energy resources, and a tech-savvy, youthful population eager to embrace the future. Governments are leading AI adoption by crafting models suited to their specific needs, supported by collaborations with global tech giants, which drive the development of essential AI infrastructure.\nDownload the complete research report from e& and the IBM Institute for Business Value: MENA’s AI advantage: Opportunity to leap ahead and lead\nStudy Methodology:\nThe IBM Institute for Business Value (IBM IBV), in collaboration with Oxford Economics, conducted two rounds of survey-based interviews with over 3,000 CEOs and 2,500 C-suite technology leaders, including Chief Technology Officers (CTOs), Chief Information Officers (CIOs), and Chief Data Officers (CDOs). Executives represented more than 30 countries and 26 industries and included 149 CEOs and 149 C-suite technology leaders from across the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. The primary phase of surveys for both groups, conducted between December 2023 and April 2024, focused on leadership, technology, talent, industry disruption, and emerging enterprise strategies with an emphasis on the role of AI-driven technologies.\ne& and IBM IBV then analysed global and regional IBM IBV survey data to further explore insights specific to the MENA region. e& supplemented and strengthened findings by conducting deep-dive qualitative interviews with six CEOs and policymakers from the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt to capture current regional perspectives and to highlight rapidly-changing industry trends in the MENA region.\nThe IBM Institute for Business Value, IBM\'s thought leadership think tank, combines global research and performance data with expertise from industry thinkers and leading academics to deliver insights that make business leaders smarter.
